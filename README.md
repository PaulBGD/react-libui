# React Native LibUI
Create UIs for every platform using the best view framework.

## Installing

First off, you'll need to have node-gyp setup.

After that make sure you have all the dependencies installed for libui.

```
npm install --save react-native-libui
```

## Running the example

There's a pretty complete example, called `examples/test.jsx`. This includes all of the components that are currently supported and shows off most of the features. You can run the example with:

```
npm run example
```

## Support

I've yet to get Windows support working perfectly.
