# React LibUI
Create UIs for every platform using the best view framework.

## Quick Start

First off, you'll need to have node-gyp setup.

After that make sure you have all the dependencies installed for [libui-node](https://github.com/parro-it/libui-node).

Then you can go ahead and install react-libui:
```
npm install --save --production react-libui
```
We follow semvar versioning.
We have no plans at this time to make a v2, so we'll try our best to make your applications run on all versions of react-libui.
